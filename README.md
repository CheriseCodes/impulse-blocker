# Impulse Blocker

Block distracting websites when you are browsing the web.

Written using [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) so it will be compatible with the future releases of Firefox.

You can install the extension from the official [add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/impulse-blocker/). Simple usage instructions are [here](https://blog.cemunalan.com.tr/2017/05/17/impulse-blocker-guide/).
